# Core UI and general utilities
tkinterdnd2-universal>=2.0.1 # For drag and drop
requests>=2.25.1 # For potential network requests (e.g., future version checks, or if _worker_filter_and_select fetched thumbnails)

# Audio/Video Processing
mutagen>=1.45.1 # For audio metadata
yt-dlp>=2023.01.01 # Assumed to be in PATH, but listing for completeness if it were a pip package. This is more of a system dependency.

# Transcription Engine and Dependencies
faster-whisper>=1.0.0 # Transcription engine
torch>=1.13.0 # For faster-whisper device detection and some ops (CPU or GPU version)
librosa>=0.9.2 # For audio loading and spectrograms
numpy>=1.23.0 # Numerical processing for librosa, matplotlib, etc.
matplotlib>=3.5.0 # For spectrogram plotting

# Note: System dependencies like ffmpeg, and yt-dlp (if not installed via pip)
# need to be handled separately by the user or environment setup.
# For PyTorch, specify CPU/GPU version as needed during installation, e.g.:
# torch --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu  (for CPU)
# torch --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118 (for CUDA 11.8, example)
